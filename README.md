# Blockchain-based-E-voting

This a final year project as a part of our BTech course.

With the evolution of digital technology, the voting system has been changed from paper to electronic systems. In a centralized environment, the results of voting events have always been questionable and perceived differently by voters. Most existing E-Voting systems are based on centralized servers where the voters must trust the organizing authority for the integrity of the results. To solve these trust issues a decentralized, trustless, voting platform that relies on Blockchain technology can be used. A Blockchain is a distributed database, where the complete data is shared among all participants in the network. As all participants have complete data, the protocol allows them to verify each block that is appended to the chain. The main features of Blockchain based E-Voting system include transparency, irreversibility, and non-repudiation. By integrating a blockchain with a simple interface, this project aims to tackle all of the existing issues and pave the way for the next generation voting system.

We intend on developing a simple web application to allow users to be able to cast votes. Using this application, validated users will be able to cast their votes from any remote locations using their mobile devices or computers.
